   ** DO NOT DELETE FIRST (4) SCRIPT INCUDES!!! They are REQUIRED as per aschar.as **

   ** INTRODUCTION : **
   ********************

   Thank you for selecting YungMoniCA's Multi-Script Mod!
   This mod was designed to use multiple script mods without changing the original "aschar.as" file.


   *******************
   *** HOW TO USE: ***
   **************** **

   1.) find the folder of the mod you want to add. 
         e.g) "Data\Mods\bow_arrow_mod\".
 
   2.) Add the mod's "aschar_xx.as" to include above. 
        (note: there should not be an aschar.as in the mod's folder as the multi-mod supplies one already)

   3.) Save. Thats It, the mod has been added to the selection. 

    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Due to the game's limitation, the mod menu will not be able to activate         |
    | or deactivate script mods, you would have to remove it from #include manually   |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

    Here is the original include list in case you deleted it. 

    #include "interpdirection.as"
    #include "aschar_aux.as"
    #include "aircontrols.as"
    #include "../Data/Mods/multi_script_mod/Data/Scripts/aschar.as"
