# OG-Multi-Script-Mod
This is a mod that has been created and designed by me. It currently does not work as of yet but it is meant to allow script mods to be enabled using the integrated mod support in Overgrowth to add multiple script mods without changing the original files or even the other script files. I will keep everyone updated when something new is available.
